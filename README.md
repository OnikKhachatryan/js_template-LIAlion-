# LIAlion Template

LIAlion is a clean and modern front-end template built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a stylish login and sign-up interface with smooth transitions, transparent design elements, and a responsive layout. This project helped me practice working with layouts, forms, and DOM manipulation, and it can be reused or customized for different UI needs.

##  Features

- Login and Sign Up UI with toggle functionality
- Transparent form design with gradient background
- Sections for Home, About, Services, and Contact
- Responsive layout (desktop-first)
- Basic input styling and social icon integration



No frameworks or dependencies required.

##  Tools & Skills Practiced

- HTML5 & semantic structure
- CSS3 (flexbox, gradients, custom UI design)
- JavaScript DOM manipulation

##  Purpose

This project was part of my learning process as a junior front-end developer. I focused on building a more interactive and visually appealing UI, while also learning how to organize structure and styles better across multiple files.
